Assuming this code is already on your computer and runs.
CAD can be found at RightHand_Eric/CAD/Testing Apparatus/Finger puller/

1) Plug the Labjack into the computer
2) There should be an evenly split voltage divider between power and ground, with a probe going to AIN0 touching the center of the voltage divider. AIN0 should read 2.5V when the finger wire survives.
3) roslaunch rhr_testbench finger_puller.launch
4) You'll be asked if the finger is new or if its already done cycles. If you tell it 'n' (no, it's not new) it will first check in the rhr_testbench/log directory for the last cycle count. If it doesn't find any log files, it will ask you for how many cycles have already been run. Tell it.
5) Connect the motor to 8V power. If you use a differenct power supply, change the cycle_hz value in finger_pulleR_tracker.cpp
6) Now every 4 seconds the cycle counter log file should update, and if the finger wire ever should break a log file should note roughly how many cycles it took to break.
